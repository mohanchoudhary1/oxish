OxiSH is an SSH server written in Rust. It is currently a minimum viable product and
not yet ready for production use. It is intended to be a secure, modern SSH server that supports post-quantum key exchange and FIPS-validated cryptography.

## Features

- Only support modern cryptography, including hybrid post-quantum key exchange
- Support for FIPS-validated cryptography on Linux when compiled with `aws-lc-fips` crypto
- Usable as server and library, including sans-I/O protocol implementation

If any features you need are missing, please open an issue or submit a pull request.

## Limitations

- Only supports Linux and macOS for now (looking for a Windows contributor)
- Only supports public key authentication for now
- No SFTP support yet
- Requires clients with support for mlkem768x25519-sha256 key exchange (OpenSSH 9.9+)
- No support for older cryptographic algorithms

## Supported cryptographic algorithms

- Key exchange:
  - [`mlkem768x25519-sha256`](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc10042.html)
  - [`curve25519-sha256`](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8731)
- Public key:
  - [`ed25519`](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8709)
  - [`ecdsa-sha2-nistp256`](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5656)
- Encryption:
  - [`aes128-gcm@openssh.com`](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5647)
